# Wake on lan Portal

With this portal you can use wakeonlan with a modern webinterface. It is multi-user capable. Administrators can create, delete and manage users. I recommend to use the wakeonlan portal with nginx. A manual can be found here: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html

It is important to adjust the Secret Key in settings.py.

# Installation instructions
